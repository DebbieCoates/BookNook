## Overview
<!-- 
HealMate is an online platform that allows users to:
- Register and create a profile
- Search for healthcare specialists by specialty
- Schedule appointments with the desired healthcare provider
- View profiles of registered specialists
- Access a secure dashboard based on user roles (patients, doctors, admins)
- Seamlessly manage medical appointments.

The platform ensures accessibility across all devices and browsers, and its goal is to streamline the process of finding and scheduling medical consultations. In future iterations, HealMate will add functionality         for healthcare providers to manage their schedules, send reminders to patients, and offer tools for patient-doctor communication.
-->
## UX - User Experience

### Design Inspiration
<!--
My inspiration for HealMate came from a personal experience during a routine visit to my GP. I thought about how many medical consultations, especially those that don’t require physical examinations, could easily be handled online. This thought extended to pregnant women, who often need guidance and reassurance from their midwives or doctors but don’t necessarily need an in-person visit. The convenience of a digital platform for such consultations became clear. The name HealMate reflects the idea of a supportive, reliable partner in managing one's health—much like popular health apps such as ClueMate, where ‘Mate’ signifies companionship and guidance in managing health.
-->
### Colour Scheme
<!--
 In line with the healthcare theme, I chose a neutral, clean palette:
 - **Primary Color:** #17A2B8 (Navy Blue-Grey)
 - **Secondary Color:** #132B67 (Hospital Blue)
 - **Accent Color:** #333 (grey)
 - **Background:** #fff (White)
 This combination ensures clarity, accessibility, and a professional appearance, allowing for easy navigation throughout the site.
-->
### Font
<!--
- For the logo and headers, I will be using **Lora**.
- The rest of the body text and interactive elements will use **Catamaran** for its readability and clean look.
-->

Wireframes were designed using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), ensuring responsiveness across devices.

## Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram
The ERD for HealMate illustrates the relationships between the users, specialists, appointments, and more. This is essential to demonstrate the relationships between the different models in the PostgreSQL database.

The ERD also demonstrates the platform's role-based structure. Each user is assigned to a specific group (patient, specialist, or admin) that determines their access level. PatientProfile and SpecialistProfile models are linked to the User model, and each profile type has specific fields relevant to their role. Admins have broader access to manage both specialist vetting and platform data.

![ERD Illustration](docs/erd/erd-healmate.png)

The above ERD was generated using Python Extension - pygraphviz and pydotplus. Documentation at https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/graph_models.html.
-->
## Security
<!--
All data is securely handled with Django’s security features, including:
- CSRF protection for form submissions.
- Data encryption for sensitive information like passwords using Django's built-in authentication.
- Role-based access control to restrict sensitive data to authorized users.

Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented using Django's Group and Permission systems. Patients, specialists, and admins are grouped based on their role, and their access to features and sensitive information is restricted accordingly. Patients can only access their own medical data and booking history, while specialists can only view data related to their consultations. Admins have the broadest access for system management.
-->
## Features

### User View - Registered/Unregistered
<!--
HealMate offers distinct user views. Unregistered users can search for specialists, but registered users have full access to the appointment system and dashboard functionalities.

### User Registration Process
- **Patients:** When a new user registers, they are automatically assigned to the "Patient" group. This ensures that all users begin with patient privileges and access, allowing them to book appointments and view specialist profiles. During the registration process, essential patient profile information is captured (e.g., contact number, address, date of birth, gender). After the registration is complete, a corresponding PatientProfile is automatically created and associated with the user.

- **Specialists:** During the registration process, essential patient profile information is captured (e.g., contact number, address, date of birth, gender). After the registration is complete, a corresponding PatientProfile is automatically created and associated with the user.

- **Admins:** Admin accounts are created manually by other existing admins or superusers within the Django administration area. This ensures that the creation of administrative-level accounts is strictly controlled and follows the platform's internal policies.

This registration flow was chosen to ensure role-based control and security. Patients are the primary users of the platform, and allowing them to register freely makes the service accessible. However, specialists and admins require a higher level of trust and validation, so they undergo a manual vetting process. This ensures that only qualified professionals and authorized admins can manage sensitive tasks such as consultations and platform settings, which helps maintain the integrity and security of the system.

### Role-Based Dashboard Features

**HealMate includes role-based dashboards for different types of users:**
- **Patient Dashboard:** Allows patients to view their profile, manage appointments, and access medical records.

- **Specialist Dashboard:** Specialists can manage their availability, view and approve appointments, and review patient profiles.

- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins can manage users (patients, specialists) and vet specialist applications. They also have access to system-wide settings.

### Role-Based Navigation
(Not the same as Role-Based Dashboard Features)

The navigation bar in HealMate adapts dynamically based on the user's role. This feature ensures that users see only the relevant options for their role, improving usability and reducing clutter in the interface.

- **Specialists**: When logged in, specialists will only see links to their dashboard, profile, password change, and logout options. General site navigation like "Home," "About," or "Join Us" will be hidden.
- **Patients**: Logged-in patients have access to their dashboard, profile, password change, and logout options, while still seeing general navigation links like "Home" and "About."
- **Admins**: Admins will see their dedicated dashboard link and other relevant options.
- **Non-Authenticated Users**: Users who are not logged in will only see options to log in or register on the platform.

This role-based navigation provides a tailored experience for every user type, streamlining access to the most relevant pages.


### Soft Delete/Archiving for Patient Accounts
HealMate includes a soft delete mechanism to ensure data integrity and prevent accidental loss of important user information. Instead of permanently deleting accounts, users can request a soft deletion, which deactivates their account while retaining their data in the system.

**How It Works:**
- **Patient Account Deactivation:** Patients can request to have their account deactivated through a user-friendly option on their dashboard.
- **Data Preservation:** When a patient requests account deletion, their profile is marked as inactive rather than removed from the database. This means the patient’s information, appointments, and records remain available for future use or audit purposes.
- **Admin Reactivation:** Admins have the ability to reactivate patient accounts from the Django admin panel. This ensures that patients can return to the platform with all their previous data intact, avoiding any data loss or system disruptions.

**Benefits:**
- **System Integrity:** Prevents errors that could arise from full account deletions, such as broken relationships with other models (e.g., appointments, messages, feedback).
- **User Flexibility:** Patients can choose to deactivate their account temporarily and return at a later date without losing their medical history or profile information.
- **Security:** Only admins have the power to fully manage account reactivations, ensuring oversight and control over patient data.


### Appointment Booking System
HealMate allows patients to book appointments with specialists directly through the platform. The system includes:
- **Specialist Search**: Patients can search for specialists based on name, specialty, or location.
- **Book Appointment**: Patients can book an appointment directly from the specialist's profile page.
- **Appointment Management**: Specialists and patients can view and manage upcoming appointments through their respective dashboards.
- **Appointment Cancellation**: Patients and specialists have the ability to cancel appointments with a confirmation prompt.


### Messaging System
HealMate provides a secure messaging system for communication between patients and specialists:
- **Inbox**: Users can view received messages and reply to messages directly from their inbox.
- **Send Message**: Patients can send messages to specialists they have appointments with, and vice versa.
- **Message History**: All sent and received messages are stored and displayed in the user's message history.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: The system is designed to support real-time messaging between users.


### Profile Management
Each user can manage their profile through the dashboard:
- **Patient Profile**: Patients can view and update personal details such as contact information, medical history, and emergency contacts.
- **Specialist Profile**: Specialists can view and update their bio, specialty, location, and upload profile images.
- **Profile Images**: Specialists can upload and update their profile image, which appears on the search results and specialist details page.

### Confirmation Messages
- **User Feedback**: Confirmation messages are shown to users when important actions are performed, such as logging in, booking an appointment, or sending a message. These messages help ensure a smooth user experience by providing feedback on successful actions.

### CRUD Functionality

The following **CRUD** functionalities are implemented within HealMate:

- **Create**: Patients are automatically assigned a profile upon registration. This profile includes key fields such as contact information, address, and medical history.
  
- **Read**: Patients can view their profile and associated information, including medical history and emergency contact details, from their dashboard.

- **Update**: Patients have the ability to update their profile information, including personal data (e.g., contact number, address, and medical history), via a dedicated "Edit Profile" page.

- **Delete (Soft Delete)**: Patients can request to deactivate their account through a **soft delete** mechanism. This deactivation preserves the patient’s data within the system while preventing further access until reactivation by an admin. The admin can reactivate the account from the Django admin panel at any time, restoring full access for the patient.

This CRUD cycle is central to the **PatientProfile** model, ensuring that users can fully manage their personal information while providing system integrity with the soft delete functionality.

- **Responsiveness**: The platform has been tested on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices to ensure optimal performance.
- **Role-Based Dashboard Testing:** Each user type (patient, specialist, admin) was tested to ensure they were directed to the correct dashboard after login. Patients were assigned to the correct group during registration, and specialists were manually added by admins. The redirection logic was thoroughly tested by registering new users and ensuring role-based access was properly applied.
- **Automatic Assignment Testing:** Tests were conducted to verify that newly registered users are automatically assigned to the "Patient" group and that their PatientProfile was successfully created. This was confirmed through both the user interface and the Django admin panel.

### **Bugs**
- ### Bug Fix #1: `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` Setting Causing Heroku Deployment Failure

**Issue:**  
During the deployment to Heroku, the following error occurred:

The error was caused by the absence of proper static file handling and a misconfiguration in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `settings.py`.

**Cause:**  
- The `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1` config variable was used in Heroku to prevent collectstatic from running during the initial setup.
- There was a duplicate entry for `django.contrib.staticfiles` in `INSTALLED_APPS`, which caused an error when trying to collect static files.

**Steps Taken to Fix:**
1. Fixed the duplicate `django.contrib.staticfiles` entry in `INSTALLED_APPS`.
2. Ensured the static and media handling was properly set up with Cloudinary and Whitenoise.
3. Deleted the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1` from Heroku's Config Vars.
4. Deployed again, which successfully collected static files and completed the deployment.


### Bug Fix #2: Permission Issues with Dashboard Access

**Issue**

Users are unable to access the Admin, Patient, and Specialist dashboards even though they are assigned to the correct user groups in the Django admin panel. The application either throws a 403 Forbidden error or does not recognize the users' group memberships.

**Cause**

The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of group membership checks in the views or misconfiguration of user group assignments within the Django admin panel.

### Steps Taken to Fix

1. **Investigate Group Check Functions**:
   - Reviewed the group-check functions (`is_admin`, `is_patient`, `is_specialist`) in `views.py` to ensure they correctly identify user groups.
   - Confirmed that the group names match those set in the Django admin.

2. **Validate Group Assignments**:
   - Ensured that users are properly assigned to the correct groups (Admin, Patient, Specialist) in the Django Admin panel.
   - Verified that the group names in the code match the group names set up in Django admin.

3. **Testing**:
   - Tested access with both existing and newly created users to ensure they can access their respective dashboards without issues.
   - Verified that group membership was properly recognized for all users.

4. **Revert Changes**:
   - Once the issue was resolved, reverted any temporary modifications to the views back to their original implementation.

5. **Verify Access Control**:
   - Tested edge cases, such as users without group assignments attempting to access dashboards, to ensure proper behavior.
   - Confirmed that custom `PermissionDenied` logic displayed the correct 403 error page for unauthorized access attempts.

**Outcome**

The problem was successfully resolved, allowing users to access their respective dashboards based on group membership without encountering 403 errors or redirection issues.

### Bug Fix #3: Form Not Visible on Homepage Due to Conflicting View Usage

### Issue
The form on the homepage not visible due to conflicting view usage. The homepage should display a form that allows users to search for specialists, but the form did not appear as expected.

### Cause
The conflict arises from the use of both a class-based `HomePage` view and a function-based `home` view. The class-based view does not properly pass the `specialties` context required to render the form on the homepage.

### Steps Taken to Fix

1. **Update URLs**:
   - Updated `core/urls.py` to replace the class-based `HomePage` view with the function-based `home` view to ensure the correct context is passed.

2. **Verify Context Passing**:
   - Verified that the `specialties` context was properly passed to `index.html` so that the form could display the list of specialties dynamically.

3. **Test Form Visibility and Functionality**:
   - Tested the homepage to ensure that the form was visible and correctly populated with the list of specialties from the database.

4. **Commit Changes**:
   - Added and committed the changes after confirming that the issue was resolved.

### Outcome
The form is now visible on the homepage and correctly displays the list of specialties, allowing users to search for specialists as intended. The conflict between the views was resolved by using the appropriate function-based view that properly passes the necessary context.


### Bug Fix #4: Signal Not Triggering on User Registration

### Issue
A Django signal intended to automatically assign new users to the "Patients" group and create a `PatientProfile` upon registration was not firing. This led to no profile being created and no group being assigned after user registration.

### Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect configuration of the `AccountsConfig` class in `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py` and missing signal imports in the `ready()` method of `accounts/apps.py`.

### Steps Taken to Fix

1. **Correct Configuration in INSTALLED_APPS**:
   - Updated `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py` to reference `'accounts.apps.AccountsConfig'` instead of just `'accounts'`. This ensured that the custom AppConfig class was properly loaded.

2. **Add Signal Imports in `ready()` Method**:
   - Added a `ready()` method in `accounts/apps.py` to correctly import the signal handlers, ensuring they were registered when the app was loaded.

3. **Remove Debug Statements**:
   - Removed unnecessary print statements that were used for debugging to keep the code clean and efficient.

### Outcome
The signal is now correctly triggered upon user registration, resulting in the automatic assignment of new users to the "Patients" group and the creation of a `PatientProfile` as intended. The configuration in `INSTALLED_APPS` and signal registration were successfully fixed.


### Bug Fix #5: Specialist Availability Submission and Display Issues

### Issue
Specialists encountered multiple issues when trying to set their availability. Initially, a 405 Method Not Allowed error occurred upon form submission. After fixing that, the start time was not displayed on the specialist dashboard, while the end time appeared correctly.

### Cause
1. **405 Method Not Allowed**:
   - The `post` method was missing from the `SpecialistDashboardView` class in `dashboard/views.py`, resulting in the 405 error when attempting to submit availability.

2. **Missing Start Time**:
   - The `start_time` was not displayed on the specialist dashboard due to a missing template tag (`{{ availability.start_time }}`) in the "Your Availability" section.

### Steps Taken to Fix

1. **Handle POST Method in View**:
   - Added a `post` method to `SpecialistDashboardView` in `dashboard/views.py` to properly handle form submissions, resolving the 405 Method Not Allowed error.

2. **Fix Start Time Rendering in Template**:
   - Updated the specialist dashboard template to include the `{{ availability.start_time }}` tag, ensuring that both the `start_time` and `end_time` are displayed in the "Your Availability" section.

### Outcome
Specialists can now successfully submit their availability without encountering the 405 error. Both `start_time` and `end_time` are displayed correctly on the specialist dashboard, providing a complete view of their available times for appointments.


### Bug Fix #6: Incorrect Template Rendered for Specialist Search Results

### Issue
The incorrect template was being rendered for specialist search results on the HealMate platform. A secondary `search_results.html` template in a different directory was causing confusion, leading to a simplified search results page being displayed. Key features like specialist bio, profile image, and pagination were missing.

### Cause
An additional `search_results.html` template was located inside the global `/templates/specialists/` directory. This template had minimal content and was unintentionally overriding the correct `search_results.html` template in the `/specialists/templates/specialists/` directory.

### Steps Taken to Fix

1. **Isolate Problematic Template**:
   - Renamed the global `/templates/specialists/` directory to determine if it was the source of the issue.

2. **Confirm and Resolve Issue**:
   - After confirming the issue was caused by the additional template, deleted the `/templates/specialists/` directory and its contents.

3. **Verify Correct Template Rendering**:
   - Verified that the correct `search_results.html` template inside `/specialists/templates/specialists/` is now rendering, displaying all necessary features, including the specialist bio, profile image, and pagination.

### Outcome
The correct template for specialist search results is now rendering as intended. The page displays all relevant information, including specialist bio, profile images, and pagination, providing users with a complete view of search results.
